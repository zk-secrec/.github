# ZK-SecreC

Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs are a cryptographic technology used to convince Relying Parties that a statement holds, while not revealing them the evidence that makes that statement hold. While ZK Proofs are already widely used in certain real-world applications, and even more ubiquitously as subroutines in cryptographic functionalities, we believe that a well-design programming language will simplify their even more general uptake. Hence we have introduced the domain-specific language ZK-SecreC.

The power of ZK-SecreC ultimately derives from its type system, which is described and justified in the following research paper:

The technical report further expanding the description is available [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.15448).

The compiler of ZK-SecreC and the associated materials are published in three repositories:

* The [compiler](https://github.com/zk-secrec/compiler) repository contains the source code of the ZK-SecreC compiler, and the standard library of ZK-SecreC.
* The [examples](https://github.com/zk-secrec/examples) repository contains a number of smaller and larger example programs written in ZK-SecreC.
* The [documentation](https://github.com/zk-secrec/documentation) repository contains the source of the documentation. The documentation includes the introduction to ZK-SecreC language, and the language reference. It also includes the documentation of ZK-SecreC compiler, and the standard library.
  * The documentation is served [here](https://zk-secrec.github.io/documentation/).

Each repository contains a README-file describing the content of the repository, and the instructions of making use of the content.

The work on ZK-SecreC has mostly been funded by DARPA under contract no. HR0011-20-C-0083. The views, opinions, and/or findings expressed are those of the author(s) and should not be interpreted as representing the official views or policies of the Department of Defense or the U.S. Government.
